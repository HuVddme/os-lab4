<div class="rendered-markdown"><h1>Creating C programs in Codio</h1>
<h3>Make a new file</h3>
<p>Use <strong>File > New File&hellip;</strong> or right-click in the file tree to create a new file. You can right-click in the file tree to rename or delete files.</p>
<p>As Codio detects which file is in focus, simply put your cursor into whichever code editor you want to compile and run.</p>
<h3>Compile, Run or Both</h3>
<p>Use the Run button (that looks like a Rocketship) to Compile and Run the file your cursor is in.</p>

<p>Use the drop-down arrow to the right of the &ldquo;Compile &amp; Run&rdquo; option to change the button to just Compile or just Run.</p>
<h3>Debug your Code</h3>
<p>Use the &ldquo;Debug Current File&rdquo; on the far right of the top menu bar to launch the debugger targeting the file your cursor is in.</p>
<h3>Reconfigure your Panels for easier development</h3>
<p>Use the <strong>View > Panels</strong> menu on the top tool bar to segment your screen.</p>
<p>Simply drag the tab of the file or terminal (the part with the name) you want to move into the new panel.</p>
